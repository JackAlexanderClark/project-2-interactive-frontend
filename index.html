            I grew up in Cheshire, later educated at Cheadle County Grammar for Girls, Cheshire. 
            Grew up in the 60s - (not swinging--- but in the Industrious Northern suburbs!)
            and my first work at 17 was in Textiles, art reproduction and Graphics
            before becoming a Tech/ information Officer in the Civil Service for
            many years.</p>
            
        <p> 
            Prior to that, ran a Country Inn with my husband, which
            nestled in the slopes of the Malvern Hills, and was constantly inspired
            there by the sheer beauty and musicality of the Shires.
            And Art was always there for me, for myself and my own creative
            efforts, but also with a burgeoning interest in Classical art, even around
            the hard-working career and family days.</p>

        <p>
             Today I can reflect on my Westerley sojourn down ------from Cheshire,
            and then being in the midst of the Three Jewel counties of
            Worcestershire, Herefordshire and Shropshire. More recently, where
            I live now, and sure to retire, ----- here in Dramatic Cornwall.
            I have been inspired by the incredulous beauty of all these Shires of
            Western England and they have influenced my sketchings and paintings
            and I hope Cornwall will inspire even more. My collection is essentially
            “the English Scene”.</p>

            I am more or less self- taught, apart from my early Textile
            Design reproduction days when I attended a course at the
            Faculty of Technology Manchester for Graphics/Printing
            processes but during my Worcestershire years I did work with
            the Worcester/Severn tutor Watercolourist, Robin Holder.
            My Style is eclectic and sometimes arbitrary but always
            influenced by a Light source. I work in Oils, Acrylics and
            Watercolours when painting Plein Air.
            I like to sketch with charcoal and for quick compositions and
            portrait, use Pastels.</p>
