# Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Frontend Application

### (UX) First time visitors
1. 

### Themes and Design
1. The primary design theme is a painting frame border to illustrate the artistic purposes - it is present throughout to provide continuity.
2. Similarly, the colours have been kept to a basic and consistent pallete. Such as light blue (#add8e6) and dark blue (#410cd3).
3. Another design philosophy was to only use a single h1 tag for each html page for aesthetics and to make important information prominant. 
4. Finally, the other design pillar was that of simplicity - there is a biography, an interactive gallery and a shop with a contact form to directly contact the artist with an item request, feedback or to purchase an item chosen from the gallery.

### Features
1. Interactive elements such as; navigation bars and scrollable gallery.
2. Despite JavaScript not being a required technology for this project, for user intuition I included a javascript function that called a google maps API, this shows the visitor Tintagel in Cornwall. This will further add immersion for the environment that inspired the art. Google maps API key: AIzaSyBqfLotXxWXWLztXjqJeCByX2v9FjqV16s.
