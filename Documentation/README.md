# Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Frontend Application

### Core Design Principles
1. The game concept is that of a simple guessing game. However, it has been fleshed out to make it much more immersive and complex using elements of interactivity and user input by using javaScript and jQuery capabilities.
2. Inspired by board games such as cluedo, an ensemble cast of classic characters have been reimagined in a more horror based theme, but will still be familiar to all those who have played cluedo and it's main game loop of investigating who commited the crime using deduction.

### Functionality and Interactivity
1. The application is designed with user interaction in mind. The navigation bar utilises new bootstrap resposnsive design with a sliding navigation bar. All the clues and suspect profiles can be clicked to trigger jquery events that will enlarge and display information - simulating a real detective interacting the evidence.
2. The modal text pop ups use a combination of javascript and jquery. I also used python flask templating to pull json data from the backend, to each unique suspect.

### UI/UX and Presentation
1. The foundations of the application were designed around bootstrap 5 grid system. I used this framework in parallel to custom css to create a skeleton layout. This would then be iterated upon with html content and then targeted with javascript and jquery events/interactions.
2. To add a higher standard to the presentation I commision an artist using a community found upon reddit. I paid them to draw me 9 composite pencil sketches, similarly to how police can create composite sketches to identify a suspect - based upon witness testimony. 
3. Similarly, a chalk blackboard was used as a continous background for theming. A colour scheme was also uniformly followed to give the app a homogenous look; crimson, whitesmoke.
